To build the code, you'll need to have CMake installed. Then execute run_cmake_win64.bat and it will create a build directory where you can find the .sln. Set the project 'demon' as the startup project, build the INSTALL project to install dependencies and you are good to go!

For now its running only on Windows. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
